== Introduction

This is a periodic review for secure development. It is conducted to find out the current state of security work and to plan the security work for the next periods.

Notice that you do not need to get a perfect score to close the review as passed, but it is sufficient if you understand the current status and have a plan to address any gaps during the next periods.

== Review checklist

=== Secure development tasks

Check the annual wheel of secure development tasks in the parent card of this card.

All Secure development tasks should have be *Closed as done* or *Closed as not applicable* and their review must not be expired.

* If there are tasks in the *Open* state, then plan how they will be scoped, or in other words decided whether they are required
* If there are secure development tasks that are required but not yet *Closed as OK*, then plan the work to perform these controls
* If there are controls that are *Closed as OK* or that are *Closed as not applicable*, but their review has expired, then plan when these secure development tasks can be reviewed and updated.

This can be marked as OK if the missing actions are planned.

* [ ] OK
* [ ] Not OK
