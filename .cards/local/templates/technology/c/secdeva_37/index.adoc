== Introduction

The risks and justifications for selecting a 3rd party technology must be documented when adopting 3rd party solutions such as

* commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) with support
* free/libre open source software (FLOSS, FOSS, OSS) with or without paid support https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html[FLOSS and FOSS - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation]
* software of unknown provenance (SOUP), any software of the previous categories or any binary solution with pedigree unproven on this field of industry

It is important to consider business compliance, intellectual property rights, user acceptance and risks throughout the projected life cycle: acquisition, integration, testing, maintenance and end-of-life. Not all the assets have to meet all the criteria. With a proper justification for accepting the related risk or deploying compensating security controls it is possible to adopt assets lacking according to these criteria.

The decision must involve the responsible architect and if there are business implications, then also involve a business responsible person in the decision. If you, as the technology selection responsible, business responsible or responsible architect, consider that you are not entitled to accept the risks, then the decision is escalated to architect team or management of the product according to the technology selection process.

The technology can be adopted for use once the following conditions are met:

* Technology selection checklist is filled, and the possible required escalations is concluded.
* Identified risks can be accepted
* Maintenance responsible is nominated
* Vulnerability management and software update management for the technology is planned and documented

Remember to inform all impacted stakeholders of the product about the decision!

== Technology selection checklist

=== Business goals

The technology is compliant with business goals:
