== Introduction

This is a review of vulnerability scanning of the #scope - add more specific scope if needed#.

Known vulnerability scanning focuses on detecting known vulnerabilities in the product hardware, host or software components. For example, this could be a network based known vulnerability scan. Known vulnerability scanning must only rely on the design specifications and externally observable behavior of the system under test (SUT). Test planning can make use of existing attack surface specifications, threat models and interface specifications.
