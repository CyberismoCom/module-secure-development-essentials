== Introduction

Known vulnerability scanning focuses on detecting known vulnerabilities in the product hardware, host or software components. For example, this could be a network based known vulnerability scan. Known vulnerability scanning must only rely on the design specifications and externally observable behavior of the system under test (SUT). Test planning could make use of the already specified attack surface specification, threat models and interface specifications. Security test planning and execution should be based on the scoping decisions further based on the product security context.
