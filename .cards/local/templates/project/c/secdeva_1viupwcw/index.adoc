== Basic security information

Document the following basic information about the development project in the fields of this card:

* *Owner:* The owner and the main contact for this development project
* *Criticality for operations:* The overall criticality of this development project for business operations
* *Risk evaluation needed:* This automatic field shows, whether the *Manage high-level risks* task is currently set as applicable. If risk evaluation is needed, then identify at least one high-level cybersecurity risk under *Design* / *Manage high-level risks*
* *Backups:* How the source code and other important files are backed up

== Applicability of the secure development process

Applying the secure development process may not be necessary for certain types of development projects. In this case, set the *Target adoption step* as None and enter a justification in the *Adoption step justification* field.

Examples of cases where secure development may not be applicable:

* Research prototypes and development done in conjunction with academic thesis work, when the results will not be used in production
* Sales and marketing demonstrations
* Products that are going to be phased out shortly

== Adoption step

The secure development process has been divided into three adoption steps. You can set the target adoption step on this page. By default, the target target adoption step is *Step 1*, which includes only the most fundamental tasks in the scope of the secure development lifecycle.

NOTE: The Cyberismo secure development essentials module includes tasks in the adoption step 1 only.

If the secure development process is not applicable for this development project, then set the target adoption step as *None*.
