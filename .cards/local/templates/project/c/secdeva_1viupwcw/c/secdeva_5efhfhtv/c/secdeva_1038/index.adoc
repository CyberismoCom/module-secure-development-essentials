Interfaces are typically a significant attack vector. Documenting the interfaces according to the interface specification template ensures that secure design principles have been applied when designing the interface.

Examples of interfaces include

* Service interfaces
* Application Programmer's Interfaces (API)
* Communication protocols and links implemented by the development project
* Physical interfaces and ports
* Media ports such as SD card slots
* Wireless connections

== How to decide if this secure development task is required

This review item is applicable, if the system includes or implements interfaces.

An interface document is required for all exposed interfaces, for which the development project is responsible. This includes

* External interfaces, where the interface may be used by external entities that are not part of the system
* Internal interfaces, which are exposed to other components or devices

== How to implement

Interfaces are documented as part of the data flow models that are included in threat models.

== How to review this task

Check that all exposed interfaces have been documented and included in the threat model and that the documents have been approved.
