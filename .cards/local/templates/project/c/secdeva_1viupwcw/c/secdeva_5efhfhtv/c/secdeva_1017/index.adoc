Product security context refers to the the security protections that are expected from the deployment environment. It is essential that the development team and the users of the product have the same understanding about the expected product security context.

== How to decide if this secure development task is required

Product security context must be documented at least on the topmost project level.

== How to implement

The product security context documentation defines, where the product is intended to be used.

{{#report}}
  "name": "secdeva/reports/createChildDocument",
  "template": "secdeva/templates/securityContext",
  "buttonLabel": "Create a security context document"
{{/report}}

== How to review this task

{{#report}}
  "name": "secdeva/reports/checkChildDocumentStatus"
{{/report}}

If the product security context has been defined in several places, such as separately on the topmost project and for subprojects, or in several different documents, then check that the definitions are aligned and not conflicting.
