Cryptography is commonly used for protecting the confidentiality or the integrity of information. When cryptography is used, it must be used properly and effectively, using appropriate algorithms and standards.

Cryptographic keys must be managed properly. This includes creation, exchange, storage, access control and other protection, renewal, revokation, and deletion of keys.

The use of specific algorithms, key lengths, and key management arrangements must be justified by referring to applicable standards or industry best practices.

Whenever human actions are required, the roles and responsibilities for implementing cryptographic controls must be defined.
