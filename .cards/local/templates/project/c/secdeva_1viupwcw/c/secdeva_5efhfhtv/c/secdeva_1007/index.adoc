A threat model identifies cyber security issues of the project based on the architecture and it is created in a systematic process. The purpose of threat modeling is to identify weaknesses, which can be addressed to minimize cybersecurity risks, prevent security incidents and minimize the impacts of security incidents.

== How to decide if this secure development task is required

A top-level threat model is required on the topmost project level, if the project includes custom software development and the project is responsible for the security of the architecture.

== How to implement

=== 1. Document the product security context

{{#report}}
  "name": "secdeva/reports/linkByIdentifier",
  "identifier": "secdeva_document_security-context",
  "messageIfNoResults": "#TODO# There are no product security context documents yet. Create a product security context document under *Design* â†’ *Document product security context*."
{{/report}}

=== 2. Create a threat model document

{{#report}}
  "name": "secdeva/reports/createChildDocument",
  "template": "secdeva/templates/threatModel",
  "buttonLabel": "Create a threat model"
{{/report}}

=== 3. Document the target of the threat model

Follow the instructions in the template.

The  diagram is the most important part of this documentation.

=== 4. Identify weaknesses

Identify weaknesses in the design and create security issues.

=== 5. Review and approve

Review and approve the threat model document.

=== 6. Corrective actions

Include the corrective actions in the backlog of the development work.

=== 7. Maintenance

Update the threat model, if the design changes.

Review the threat model at least annually and record the review in a review subtask of the threat model document.
