Security requirements define required security capabilities, required security-related features or other required security-related characteristics of the product.

== How to decide if this secure development task is required

Security requirements specification is required, if security requirements have been identified in the project.

Typical areas for security requirements include:

- General security capabilities
- Access control, permissions, permission delegation
- Anti-tampering and integrity mechanisms
- Usage of cryptography
- Secure storage of secrets

You should create security requirements, when the requirement is non-trivial and needs to be widely reviewed.

== How to implement

Create a security requirement specification and follow the instructions in the template.

{{#report}}
  "name": "secdeva/reports/createChildDocument",
  "template": "secdeva/templates/securityRequirementsSpecification",
  "buttonLabel": "Create a security requirements specification"
{{/report}}

Create individual security requirements as child cards of the security requirements specification. There is a button at the end of the document. Each security requirement includes review subtasks for 4 different roles. Write the description of the requirements and complete the reviews.

Review and approve the security requirement specification to ensure that all relevant requirements have been identified.

== How to review this task

#TODO: add an automated check for ensuring that the requirement reviews have been completed#
