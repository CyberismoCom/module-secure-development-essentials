Assigning persons to their security-related roles is done to ensure that the responsibilities get done and that people are aware of their responsibilities. Documenting the roles is also useful when planning the security trainings.

== How to decide if this secure development task is required

This control is always required, because persons need to be assigned to roles to execute the secure development processes.

== How to implement this task

Assign people to the security-related roles by editing the child cards. Add new role assignments, as needed.

{{/report}}

== How to review this task

* Check that all the required roles have been assigned
* Ensure that the nominations are up to date.
* If needed, confirm with the assignee that they are aware of this role assignment.
