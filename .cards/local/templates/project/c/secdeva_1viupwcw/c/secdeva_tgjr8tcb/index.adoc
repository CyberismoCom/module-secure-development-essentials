Cybersecurity risk management evaluates potential risks and their impact on the development organisation or customer organisations as a whole.

The scope of this high-level risk management is broad, as it considers the organisation's overall risks that are related to this development project or the results of this development project.

== How to identify high-level cybersecurity risks

=== Risks related to information systems or products

If the development project is developing an information system, then consider the following types of risks:

[%collapsible]
====
* Leaks from/corruption of/destruction of important databases or data storage
* Loss of IPR
* Loss or major changes at key suppliers, supply chain attack
* Risks that may realise if the system or product is not available
* Insecure development/testing/production environments
* Lack of proper (internal/customer) documentation
* Defects in software maintenance/updating
* Insufficient protection of cryptographic assets (e.g., signing keys)
====

=== Risks related to products

If the development project is developing a product, the cybersecurity risk assessment should comprise:

[%collapsible]
====
* Risks that may impact the health or safety of users
* Risks based on the intended purpose and reasonably foreseeable use of the product
* Risks related to the conditions of use or the operational environment
* Risks that affect any valuable assets that should be protected
* The length of time the product is expected to be in use

Risks that may happen because of weaknesses in basic cybersecurity functionality:

* Insufficient software update support, such as lack of automation risking that updates are not done
* Deficiencies in product hardening, leading to unnecessarily exposed attack surface
* Default settings are not secure, which may lead to insecure configurations being used in the field
* The essential functions of the product are not clearly identified, properly protected, or protections are not verified by test
* Identification and authentication failures / Broken or missing access control
* Deficiencies in protecting the integrity or confidentiality of data in transit or at rest
* Collecting and thereby risking unnecessary data
* Logging and monitoring failures
* Insufficient backup capabilities
* Unplanned disposal process or deficiencies in the procedures for removing data

====

=== Risks identified from security issues

When applying the secure development process, you will identify security-related issues in design, implementation, 3rd party technology, documentation, and testing. Consider, whether there are following kinds of high-level cybersecurity risks:

* Risks that may happen due to high-severity security issues
* Risks that may happen due toa chain or a combination of multiple security issues
* Risks that may happen due to a large number of open security issues
