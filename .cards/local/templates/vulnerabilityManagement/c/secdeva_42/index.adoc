== Introduction

This document is a review of the vulnerability management for #TODO: describe scope#.

== Vulnerability management

The goal of the vulnerability management of a technology is to identify and characterize potential security vulnerabilities in the used 3rd party technologies. Vulnerability management can be based on forming a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) of the product and using a tool to track new vulnerabilities based on the SBOM, or on using a tool that tracks vulnerabilities based on the binary of the product.

#TODO: document here, how the vulnerability management for the scope is done:#

* #Which tools are used, and which vulnerability databases these tools are configured to use#
* #Whether and how the vulnerability management addresses previous supported versions of the product in addition to the current/latest version of the product#
* #By whom and how often the findings from the tools are processed#
* #By whom and how the information about vulnerabilities that may be published by the 3^rd^ party suppliers is processed#
