== Getting started

Follow these steps to get started:

=== 1. Decide the applicability of the secure development process

Applying the secure development process may not be necessary for certain types of development projects. In this case, set the *Target adoption step* field as *None* and enter a justification in the *Adoption step justification* field.

Examples of cases where secure development may not be applicable:

* Research prototypes and development done in conjunction with academic thesis work, when the results will not be used in production
* Sales and marketing demonstrations
* Products that are being phased out

{{#if this.project}}

=== 2. Decide the target adoption step

The secure development process has been divided into three _adoption steps_. You can set the target adoption step on this page. By default, the target target adoption step is *Step 1*, which includes only the most fundamental tasks in the scope of the secure development lifecycle.

NOTE: The Cyberismo secure development essentials module includes tasks in the adoption steps 1 and 2 only.

=== 3. Enter basic security information

Document the following information about the project in the fields of this card:

{{#each this.project}}
{{#if this.[base/fieldTypes/owner]}}
* [x] *Owner:* The owner and the main contact for this development project
{{else}}
* [ ] *Owner:* The owner and the main contact for this development project
{{/if}}
{{#if this.[ismsa/fieldTypes/assetCriticalityForOperations]}}
* [x] *Criticality for operations:* The overall criticality of this project for business operations
{{else}}
* [ ] *Criticality for operations:* The overall criticality of this project for business operations
{{/if}}
{{#if this.[ismsa/fieldTypes/assetBackups]}}
* [x] *Backups:* How the source code and other important files are backed up
{{else}}
* [ ] *Backups:* How the source code and other important files are backed up
{{/if}}
{{/each}}

=== 4. Start with the first secure development tasks

* The first foundational tasks have been grouped under {{#each foundationPhase}}xref:{{this.key}}.adoc[{{this.title}}]{{/each}}
* Completing the task {{#each securityContextTask}}xref:{{this.key}}.adoc[{{this.title}}]{{/each}} will provide important background information for risk assessment and threat modeling
* To identify the first cybersecurity risks, see {{#each riskManagementTask}}xref:{{this.key}}.adoc[{{this.title}}]{{/each}}
* Documenting the architecture in a dataflow model will be useful in identifying weaknesses and in more detailed risk assessment. See {{#each threatModelTask}}xref:{{this.key}}.adoc[{{this.title}}]{{/each}}
{{else}}
As the *Target adoption step* has been set to *None*, secure development is not applicable.
{{/if}}
