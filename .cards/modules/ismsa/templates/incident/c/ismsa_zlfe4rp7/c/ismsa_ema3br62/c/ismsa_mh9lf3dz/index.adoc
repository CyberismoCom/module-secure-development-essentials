== Task description

GDPR requires that data subjects must be notified of personal data breaches 
if they are likely to cause a high risk to their rights and freedoms. 
The controller shall then communicate the personal data breach 
to the data subject without undue delay, so that the data subject 
can take measures such as blocking their credit cards.
