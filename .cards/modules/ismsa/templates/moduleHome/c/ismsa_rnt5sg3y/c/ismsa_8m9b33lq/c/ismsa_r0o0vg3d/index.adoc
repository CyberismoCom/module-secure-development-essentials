## Supporting assets

Supporting Assets include hardware, devices and equipment, software and applications, roles, locations and utilities, organisational infrastructure (e.g. policies, procedures and supporting ICT services). These are groupped into separate registers.

Sufficient protection level for supporting assets is proportionate to their importance for the primary assets.
