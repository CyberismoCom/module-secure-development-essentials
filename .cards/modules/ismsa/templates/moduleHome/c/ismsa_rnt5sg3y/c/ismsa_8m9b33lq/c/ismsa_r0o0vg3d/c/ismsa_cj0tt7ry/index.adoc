## Devices

Devices that support primary assets. In addition to fields that are mandatory for all assets (such as owner or criticality), the following characteristics need to be defined for devices:

* Access Control

* Vulnerability and patch management

* Backups

**Note**: If devices are already listed in some other asset register, add new category and
add there a link to the original asset register containing needed information.
