== Task description

* Document risk treatment plans as tasks or controls. Use a task for smaller fixes and controls for larger things that will be shown in diagrams and in the statement of applicability.

*Note*: any controls that are under the risk are automatically linked to the risk with an "is mitigate by" link. 
Relevant controls that are in the control register need to be linked manually using the "mitigates/is mitigated by" link type.

* Ensure you have risk treatment plans for each risk that is not on an acceptable level

* Remember to progress the status by choosing "Complete treatment planning" once treatment planning has been completed
