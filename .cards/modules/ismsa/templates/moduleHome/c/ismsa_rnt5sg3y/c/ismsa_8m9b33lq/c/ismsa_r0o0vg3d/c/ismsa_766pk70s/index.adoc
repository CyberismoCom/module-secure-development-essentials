## Information systems

Information systems support primary assets. In addition to fields that are mandatory for all assets (such as owner or criticality), the following characteristics need to be defined for
information systems:

* Access controls attributes (AD/local accounts, accessibility from public networks, MFA)

* Responsibility for security updates

* Backups

* Level of logging and monitoring

**Note**: If information systems are already listed in some other asset register, just add a link here and ensure that the original asset register contains the needed information.
