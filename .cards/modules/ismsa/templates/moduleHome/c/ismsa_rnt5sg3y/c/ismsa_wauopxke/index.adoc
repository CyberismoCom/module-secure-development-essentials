## Company incident register

Incidents are managed according to Incident Management Process. #TODO add link to relevant process#

New incidents are recorded using the incident template that contains four cards:

* Incident - This card is for incident description and analysis.

* Incident Response - This is a subtask for documenting containment, eradication and recovery actions.

* Incident Communication: This is a subtask for documenting incident communication towards authorities, customers, other external parties and internally.

* Post-incident actions: This is a subtask for documenting lessons learned and other post-incident activities.

*Note*: If an incident contains CONFIDENTIAL information, it can be stored at separately selected location with limited access. A link to material is added to incidents that are recorded here.
